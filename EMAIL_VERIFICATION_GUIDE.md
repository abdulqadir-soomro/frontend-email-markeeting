# Email Verification Guide

## Overview
The email marketing platform now includes a comprehensive email verification system using Firebase Authentication. Users must verify their email address before they can access the dashboard.

## How It Works

### User Signup Flow
1. **User Creates Account:**
   - User enters email and password on signup page
   - Account is created in Firebase Authentication
   - Account is saved to Firestore database with `emailVerified: false`

2. **Verification Email Sent:**
   - Firebase automatically sends a verification email
   - Email contains a secure verification link
   - Link is valid for 24 hours

3. **User Verifies Email:**
   - User clicks the verification link in their email
   - Firebase marks the email as verified
   - User can now log in to the platform

4. **Login with Verification:**
   - System checks if email is verified during login
   - Verified users can access the dashboard
   - Unverified users see an error message with option to resend

## Features

#### If Try to Login Without Verifying:
```

```

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Configuration
The system uses Firebase Authentication's built-in email verification:

```javascript
import { sendEmailVerification } from 'firebase/auth';

// Send verification email
await sendEmailVerification(user, {
  url: window.location.origin + '/auth',
  handleCodeInApp: false
});
```

### Login Verification Check
```javascript
// During login
const user = userCredential.user;

if (!user.emailVerified) {
  setErrorMessage('Please verify your email before logging in.');
  return;
}

// Allow login to proceed
```

### Files Modified
1. **`pages/auth.js`**
   - Added `sendEmailVerification` import
   - Added verification state management
   - Added `handleResendVerification` function
   - Added verification check in login
   - Added verification message UI
   - Modified signup flow

2. **`public/styles.css`**
   - Added `.verification-message` styles
   - Added `.verification-icon` styles
   - Added `.verification-actions` styles
   - Added `.verification-tips` styles
   - Added button styles (`.btn-resend`, `.btn-back`)

## Customization

### Email Template
The verification email is sent by Firebase and can be customized in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Authentication → Templates
3. Email address verification
4. Customize subject and body
5. Use `%LINK%` for verification link
6. Use `%EMAIL%` for user's email

### Verification URL
After verification, users are redirected to:
```javascript
url: window.location.origin + '/auth'
```

Change this to redirect elsewhere if needed.

### Verification Expiration
Firebase default: 24 hours
- Cannot be changed without Firebase Admin SDK
- Users can request a new link anytime

## Testing

2. Check that verification email is received

4. Verify redirect to login page
5. Log in with verified account
6. Confirm access to dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Verification emails not being sent
**Solution:**
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Templates
- Verify sender email is configured
- Check email provider's spam settings
- Ensure SMTP settings are correct

**Problem:** Users can't find verification email
**Solution:**
- Tell users to check spam/junk folder
- Verify correct email address was entered
- Use "Resend Verification Email" button
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Email for delivery logs

**Problem:** Verification link doesn't work
**Solution:**
- Link may have expired (24 hours)
- Resend new verification email
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Firebase configuration

**Problem:** Users verified but still can't log in
**Solution:**
- Have user sign out completely
- Clear browser cache
- Try logging in again
- Check Firebase Console → Authentication → Users for verification status

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Security Features
- Secure Firebase authentication
- Unique verification links per user
- 24-hour link expiration
- No verification = no access
- Links cannot be reused

### 🔐 Best Practices
1. Always require email verification for new users
2. Don't store sensitive data before verification
3. Regular monitoring of failed verification attempts
4. Use HTTPS for all authentication pages
5. Implement rate limiting for resend requests

## Admin Considerations

### Monitoring
Admins can check verification status in:
- Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
- Look for "Email verified" column
- Filter by verified/unverified users

### Manual Verification
If needed, admins can manually verify users:
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. Select user
3. Click "Email verified" checkbox
4. Or use Firebase Admin SDK

### User Support
If users report verification issues:
1. Check Firebase Console for user
2. Verify email was sent (check logs)
3. Check verification status
4. Can resend verification from console
5. Can manually verify if needed

## Google Sign-In
**Note:** Google Sign-In users are automatically verified since Google has already verified their email.
